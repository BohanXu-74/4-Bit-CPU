# 4-Bit-CPU
This repository contains a custom-built 4-bit CPU designed to explore how processors work at the lowest level. The CPU implements a simple instruction set with registers, an ALU, a program counter, and control logic, making it possible to trace every instruction cycle-by-cycle. The focus is on clarity and learnability rather than performance, serving as a foundation for understanding and building more advanced CPU designs.
